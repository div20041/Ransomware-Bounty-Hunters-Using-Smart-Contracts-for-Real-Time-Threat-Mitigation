# Ransomware-Bounty-Hunters-Using-Smart-Contracts-for-Real-Time-Threat-Mitigation
This project detects ransomware-infected files using ClamAV, an open-source antivirus engine. When a file is uploaded, it's scanned for known ransomware signatures. If detected, the system explains why itâ€™s flagged, and the result is logged immutably on the blockchain using a smart contract (Truffle + Ganache).
